## C++ OOP Concepts Exploration

This repository explores various Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in C++ through a single project with incremental changes. The project starts with a basic structure and gradually incorporates new concepts throughout the code.

**Target Audience**

This repository is intended for programmers familiar with the C++ basics who want to learn or solidify their understanding of OOP concepts. 

**Project**

The project revolves around a chosen concept (e.g., Shape, Animal). Each folder represents a stage in the development, progressively introducing a new OOP concept. The code within each folder is functional and demonstrates the specific concept being explored.

**Concepts Covered**

* Classes and Objects
* Encapsulation
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism
* Virtual Functions
* Abstract Classes
* Interfaces
* Templates (Optional)

**Folder Structure**

```
cpp_oop_exploration/
├── readme.md (**this file**)
├── Stage_0  // Basic project structure
│   └── ... (project files)
├── Stage_1  // Encapsulation example
│   └── ... (project files)
├── Stage_2  // Inheritance example
│   └── ... (project files)
├── ...      // More stages for additional concepts
└── Stage_N  // Final stage with all concepts implemented
    └── ... (project files)
```

**Learning Approach**

1. Start with Stage_0 and understand the basic project functionalities.
2. Move to subsequent stages, comparing the code changes with the previous stage.
3. Focus on the new files and code modifications introduced in each stage.
4. Refer to the comments and descriptive variable names to understand the purpose of the changes.

**Additional Notes**

* Each stage includes comments to explain the concepts being introduced.
* Feel free to modify and experiment with the code within each stage. 
* Compile and run the code to observe the practical implications of the concepts.

**Compiling and Running**

The specific compilation and execution commands will vary depending on your development environment. However, standard C++ compilation and execution steps should apply.

This repository provides a guided exploration of OOP concepts in C++. By following the incremental changes and understanding the code, you can solidify your grasp of OOP principles in C++.

**Disclaimer**

This is a basic structure, and you might need to adjust it based on your specific project and the chosen concepts.
